I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr.\ Federica Bazzocchi, for her guidance and support throughout this work.  
Her input was valuable during both the planning and development phases of the project.  

A sincere thank you goes to Isac Pasianotto and Ruggero Lot, who originally built the \emph{VirtualOrfeo} environment.  
Their work provided the foundation for this thesis, making it possible to test and validate the application safely.  
In particular, I thank Isac for his assistance with Authentik integration and testing, and Ruggero for his support with system configuration and deployment.

I am also grateful to Dr. Marco Prenassi for helping me take the first steps in Django, which proved fundamental in the early development of the application.

I would like to extend my thanks to the entire LADE team for their collaboration and technical insights, with special mention to Gianfranco Gallizia for his constant availability and advice.  My gratitude also goes to the LAME team for their openness and support, in particular to Paolo Ronchese, whose expertise in microscopy was essential to ground this project in real laboratory practice.  

Last but not least, I warmly thank my parents and my sister Francesca, for their continuous encouragement and support, without which this work would not have been possible.
